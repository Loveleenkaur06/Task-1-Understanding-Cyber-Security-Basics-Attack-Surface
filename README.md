# Task-1-Understanding-Cyber-Security-Basics-Attack-Surface
## Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of the Cyber Security Internship.  
The task focuses on understanding core cyber security concepts, common attackers, attack surfaces, and real-world application scenarios.

## Task Description
The objective of this task is to build a strong foundation in cyber security by learning how systems, networks, and data are protected from digital attacks. The task also emphasizes understanding where attacks can occur and how attackers exploit weaknesses.

## Topics Covered

### Introduction to Cyber Security
- Definition and importance of cyber security
- Protection of systems, networks, and digital data
- Relevance in personal, business, and government environments

---

### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring information is accessed only by authorized users  
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data accuracy and preventing unauthorized modification  
- **Availability** – Ensuring systems and services are accessible when required  

Includes:
- Real-world examples
- Common threats
- Practical applications in healthcare, banking, cloud services, and e-commerce platforms

---

### Types of Cyber Attackers
- Cybercriminals (financially motivated)
- Script Kiddies
- Hacktivists
- Nation-State Actors
- Insider Threats (malicious, accidental, collusion)

---

### Common Attack Surfaces
- Email-based attacks (Phishing, BEC, VEC)
- Social engineering attacks (Spear phishing, Pretexting, Baiting, Vishing, Smishing)
- Web-based attacks (XSS, SQL Injection, SSRF, Keyloggers)
- Supply chain attacks
- Human factor as a major security weakness

---

### Daily Application Attack Mapping
**Example: Banking Application**
- User enters login credentials
- Data flows to the server and database
- Identification of possible attack points at each stage

---

### Data Flow & Attack Points
**Data Flow:**  
User → Application → Server → Database

**Attack Possibilities:**
- User side: Phishing, weak passwords
- Application side: XSS, insecure input handling
- Server side: Misconfiguration, outdated software
- Database side: Unauthorized access, data leakage

## Files in This Repository
- **Task 1.pdf**  
  Contains a detailed explanation of cyber security basics, CIA Triad, attacker types, attack surfaces, data flow analysis, and conclusion.

---

## Tools & Resources Used
- Google Search
- OWASP resources
- Cyber security blogs and articles
- Self-research and documentation
- GitHub

---

## Learning Outcome
By completing this task, I gained:
- A clear understanding of cyber security fundamentals
- Awareness of real-world cyber threats and attackers
- Knowledge of common attack surfaces
- Understanding of how data flows in applications and where attacks can occur
